Both of these are important details as they outline to two ways the conversation happened. Many small interactions over just a few accounts and a ball of a high volume of discourse. This lead me to show two images, one of the overall and one with just the main component. I also chose to only display the names of nodes with over 100 out strength. Showing all the names created too much clutter and this allowed the most important nodes to have extra detail. Structure was made with a combination of Force Atlas 2, Yifan Hu Proportional, and No Overlap.\n",
