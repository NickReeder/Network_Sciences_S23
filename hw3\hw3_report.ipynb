        "I found using Gephi to at first be challenging, but eventually intuitive. I bounced between the USA map and using ForceAtlas, but decided to use the USA Geoplot as it allowed for a more intuitive read of the graph. After setthing the Geoplot I used the NoOverlap to spread some nodes out. Because there were so many nodes and edges, I found minimizing edge crossing to be rather challening. This was another advantage of the USA Geoplot as even if the edge got covered, one could fairly easily see its direction and intuit the start/end points. \n",
